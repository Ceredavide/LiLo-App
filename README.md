# 1. Introduction and Goals

## 1.1 Context and Purpose

The LiLo-APP was developed in collaboration with the committee of the Liceo di Locarno. The primary goal of this application was to provide students with various types of information, such as general announcements, registration for self-managed days, notifications about teacher absences, and more.

## 1.2 Project Duration

The project officially lasted for three years. However, with the advent of Moodle due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the application became redundant and was eventually phased out.

## 1.3 User Engagement

During its active period, the application had around 400 users, a significant portion of whom used the app daily, especially during the period of self-managed days.

## 1.4 Personal Experience and Learning

From a personal perspective, developing LiLo-APP was a valuable learning experience. It marked the beginning of my journey into the world of programming. Throughout the development process, I continuously improved the project by fixing bugs, refining the code (refactoring), and adding new features.

The iterative improvement and hands-on experience gained from this project have significantly contributed to my skills and understanding of software development.

## 1.5 Task Definition

The primary task of the LiLo-APP was to serve as an information hub for students at the Liceo di Locarno. The application was designed to fulfill several key functions:
- **Announcements**: Provide timely and relevant announcements to students regarding school events, schedule changes, and other important information.
- **Self-Managed Days Registration**: Facilitate the registration process for students participating in self-managed days, ensuring a smooth and organized sign-up experience.
- **Teacher Absence Notifications**: Notify students promptly about the absence of teachers, helping them stay informed and adjust their schedules accordingly.
- **General Information**: Serve as a repository for various pieces of information that students might need on a daily basis, improving communication between the school administration and the student body.

## 1.6 Quality Goals

The development of the LiLo-APP aimed to achieve several quality goals to ensure a reliable and user-friendly experience for students:
- **Usability**: The application should be easy to navigate and use, with an intuitive interface that allows students to quickly access the information they need.
- **Performance**: The app should load quickly and respond promptly to user interactions, providing a seamless experience without significant delays or downtime.
- **Reliability**: The application should be robust and stable, minimizing crashes and ensuring that the information provided is accurate and up-to-date.
- **Security**: Student data and information should be protected with appropriate security measures to ensure privacy and prevent unauthorized access.
